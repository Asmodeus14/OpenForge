# OpenForge

**OpenForge** is a decentralized, developer-first collaboration platform that combines open-source workflows with Web3-native trust, ownership, and incentives.

Think **GitHub + DAO + Escrow**, built for the next generation of builders.

## 🚀 What is OpenForge?

OpenForge enables developers, teams, and organizations to:

- Collaborate on projects transparently
- Manage contributions and milestones with trustless escrow
- Build public or private projects without platform lock-in
- Own their work, reputation, and incentives on-chain

Unlike traditional platforms, OpenForge does **not** rely on centralized trust.
